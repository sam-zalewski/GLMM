   This study develops a mixed-effects logistic regression model to predict hospitalization among patients undergoing hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease (ESRD), a significant health concern due to its high cost and the burden on healthcare resources. Using a retrospective dataset of 1311 patients with 9547 observations, hospitalization was modeled as a binary outcome, with robust model and component selection processes used to select a best-performing model. This mixed-effects logistic regression model that predicted hospitalization with an AUC of 0.865, confirming its efficacy in classifying high-risk patients. Further, the predictive significance of treatment facilities ($p$= 0.019) in patient outcomes emphasizes the need for targeted research to explore how facility-related factors influence hospitalization rates.
